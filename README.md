# Syntax Highlighting for Arturo language in Kakoune
thats basically all it is
if you want to install it, put it in your plugins directory presumebly:

`$HOME/.config/kak/plugins/arturo.kak`

and then add this to your kakrc:

`source %val{config}/plugins/arturo.kak`

or if you use plug.kak you can also just add this line to your kakrc:

`plug "g3rwy/kakoune-arturo"`

and it should be fine
